    <p class="snekpar">I originally started this project in 2021 after it was suggested by my father, a data scientist with many years of experience who constantly encourages me to learn and progress.</p>

    <p class="snekpar">The game engine I used for this project is the Python Pygame library. It took me some time to get used to it, but eventually I was able to comfortably utilize in some while loops and to create visuals.

            Finished on <time datetime="2022-08-23">August 23rd</time>, this translator translates English into Morse Code and vice versa. As mentioned in the title, this was created with JavaScript, a language very new to me.
        </p>
        <p class="mctpar">
            I first started this project by writing the functions in Python, which I later copied in JS by googling everything. After getting stuck and receiving help from the Stack Overflow community, I finished the JS part of the project and started on the HTML.
        </p>
        <p class="mctpar">
            The most difficult part of the HTML was probably the button and the text areas. The CSS was even harder, trying to position said button and text areas in a way that they would look good if the user resized the browser window, or were on a mobile device instead of a desktop. The translator can be found <a href="https://velkycat.github.io/mct/main.html">here.</a>

            TCG (not the Trading Card Game, though I was into that as well) is a forum on the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com">Art of Problem Solving website</a>, a space where any grade can learn anything.

        <p class="aopspar">
            While I was taking a pre-algebra course on AoPS, I decided to found a forum called "Lionblaze's Den," named after my favorite character (at the time) from the Warriors book series. The forum died some short time after, and I gave up on the idea of creating a forum, until my friends on AoPS surprised me with a new forum they had founded on <time datetime="2020-02-21">February 21st, 2020</time>.
        </p>
        <p class="aopspar">
            We hang around on the forum trying to grow it, until I wasn't able to go online in late <time datetime="2020-05">May</time> of the same year. When I came back in <time datetime="2020-09">September</time>, I was shocked to find that a user by the name of <a href="#">eflower2000</a> had joined during the summer and brought the forum into its golden age. Every thread was so active you could refresh the page every ten seconds and a new message would pop up.
